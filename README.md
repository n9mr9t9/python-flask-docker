## Hierarchical Clustering 
**Hierarchical Clustering** is an unsupervised clustering algorithm which involves creating clusters that have predominant ordering from top to bottom. The endpoint is a set of clusters or groups, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other. 
**Agglomerative clustering** is a type of hierarchical clustering which follows a bottom up approach where each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy. 
A **dendrogram** is a type of tree diagram showing hierarchical relationships between different sets of data. Just by looking at a dendrogram one is able to visualise how a cluster is formed. 
Hierarchical clustering can be used to generate phylogenetic trees. **Phylogenetic trees** represent the evolutionary relationships among organisms and can be used to trace the origin of pathogens.
